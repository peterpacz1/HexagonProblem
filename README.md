HexagonProblem
==============

My way of solving the math challenge question

Imagine there is a hexagon. At each vertices of the hexagon, a random number between 1 and 6 exists. There are no duplicate numbers. If each number at the hexagon's vertice is multiplied by it's adjacent vertice, and the sum of which is added up together, which arrangement of numbers would yield the hexagon with the smallest number?
